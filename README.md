
### Work sample

#### Server-side calculator (vanilla PHP)

This is a work sample I completed for a prospective employer

I was handed a HTML template and asked to program it to do various tasks.

### Tasks

- enable the calculator to perform 2 fundamental arithmetic operations (add, subtract, divide, multiply) on positive integers
- entering numbers with more than one digit should perform like a "real" calculator, meaning that numbers should move to the left when new ones appear
- performing multiple consecutive operations on numbers should be possible while displaying the current intermediate result in the display 
- the buttons "C" (clear) and "=" (Show result) should perform as expected 
- the code should be structured in a way that makes future enhancements and additional functions easy to implement

### Restrictions

- no JS nor cookies are to be used
